# Project-2: Health Nutrition and population statistics for 14 governments at random, and applying machine learning to predict GDP expenditure on health  government and build a bot for data inquiries:
Three indicators used are: 
	1. Life expectancy 
	2. GDP expenditure ratio on health 
        3. Basic sanitary access;
Apply clustering for classification and Logistic Regression to predict future GDP expenditure on  health as follows: 
	Import data Prepare the data Cluster the countries by life expectancy using K-means Visualize  and compare the results Predict 	       GDP expenditure to improve life expectancy (Countries  Classification):
	Create a Logistic Regression Model with the original Data 
		- Predict a Logistic Regression Model with Resample Training data 
		- Calculate the accuracy of the model 
		- Generate a confusion matrix and classification report.
