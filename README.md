# Project-2  Health Nutrition and population statistic by 14 government picked randomly apply classification using clustering and apply machine learning technique to predict life expectancy and GDP growth by government. 

Three indicators are used: 
    - Life expectancy
    - GDP expandature ratio on health
    - Basic sanitary access
   
   Method 1: apply to predict future GDP expendure on health to improve life expectancy
        import the data 
        prepare the data
        Cluster the countries by life expectancy using K-means
        Visualize and compare the results
        Predict GDP expanditure to improve life expectancy (Countries Classification):
            - Split the Data into Training and Testing sets
            - Create a Logistic Regression Model with original Data
            - Predict a Logistic Regression Model with Resample Training data
            - Calculate the accuracy of the model
            - Generate a confusion matrix and classification report.
        
    Method 2: Apply prophet or neural networks to predict future GDP expendure on health to improve life expectancy
        - Prepare data for use on a neural network model
        - Evaluate a classification model using neural network
        - Optimize the neural network model
